# Noise

This project is an implementation of the [Noise Protocol Framework](http://www.noiseprotocol.org/) in Go. The Noise Protocol Framework is a set of protocols for secure communication that can be combined to provide various levels of security and functionality. The goal of the framework is to provide a flexible and easy-to-use tool for secure communication in a variety of settings.

## Installation

To install the Noise package, run:

    go get github.com/galadd/noise

## Usage

The Noise package provides a simple interface for building Noise protocols. The package provides a `HandshakeState` type, which can be used to perform the Noise handshake. The `HandshakeState` type provides methods for sending and receiving handshake messages, and for generating encryption keys.

The `HandshakeState` type is initialized with a `HandshakePattern` and a `CipherSuite`. The `HandshakePattern` specifies the handshake pattern to use, and the `CipherSuite` specifies the cryptographic primitives to use. The `CipherSuite` type is defined in the `crypto` package, and provides a simple interface for using the cryptographic primitives.

The `HandshakeState` type provides methods for sending and receiving handshake messages. The `WriteMessage` method is used to send a handshake message, and the `ReadMessage` method is used to receive a handshake message. The `WriteMessage` method takes a payload as input, and the `ReadMessage` method returns a payload as output. The payload is encrypted using the encryption keys generated by the handshake.
